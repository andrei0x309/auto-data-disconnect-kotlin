# [Root] Auto Data Disconnect

This is an app that I first add around 2018 that automatically disconnects LTE data.
On older Android versions < 4 this could have been done without root and and even without hook into NM.
Should work on newer android versions only with root.

> Code pretty much is the same as when it was first wrote, only recent update was to update all dependencies so it's best fit for chrome play.
